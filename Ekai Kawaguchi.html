                                <p>
                                    Ekai Kawaguchi (1866-1945) was an early Tibetan explorer and monk who was the first Japanese to visit Nepal. After studying Tibetan in Darjeeling, 34-year-old Kawaguchi came to Nepal in 1899 with the intention of secretly entering Tibet, which was then closed to foreigners. At first, he was hesitating whether to go to Tibet via Bhutan or Nepal. Ultimately, even though he failed to enter Tibet, he chose the Nepalese route, considering that Nepal has many Sanskrit manuscripts and many sacred Buddhist sites. He was also interested in the fact that no Japanese had ever visited Nepal. The final reason I chose the Nepal route was my encounter with a Nepali man named Jit Bahadur K.C. in Darjeeling. He wrote a letter of recommendation to Boudhanath's 'Chinya Lama' Buddha Vajra, who would later host Kawaguchi in Kathmandu. 
                                </p>

                                After collecting information on various routes to Tibet, Mr. Kawaguchi headed to Tsarang on the Mustang via Pokhara, Tukche and Marfa. At Tsarang, he studied Buddhism and Tibetan rhetoric under the guidance of Mongolian Buddhist scholars. He then retired to Marfa and eventually managed to cross the Tibetan border covertly through the Dhaulagiri Himal pass.
Kawaguchi pretended to be a local Tibetan and stayed in Tibet for about two years. Eventually his nationality was revealed and he was forced to leave Tibet. He escaped with great difficulty and returned to Darjeeling, where he learned that some of his Tibetan friends who had helped him had been arrested by the Tibetan authorities. Kawaguchi decided to make his second visit to Nepal in the hope that Prime Minister Chandra Shumsha Rana would deliver a petition to the 13th Dalai Lama asking for the release of his Tibetan friend. Kawaguchi also asked the prime minister to accept a set of Japanese Sanskrit Buddhist manuscripts for Nepal.Â

                                    He returned to Japan in May 1903, but returned to Nepal in March 1905 and presented all 100 volumes of Tripitaka to the prime minister. The set is now kept in the National Archives, Kathmandu. In response, Prime Minister Chandra Shumsha instructed government officials to collect various Sanskrit manuscripts and submit them to Kawaguchi. Kawaguchi also collected many Sanskrit manuscripts himself, as well as Buddhist scrolls, paintings and religious items.
During his third visit to Nepal, the pastor waited for Sanskrit manuscripts to be collected. Kawaguchi wrote a long letter to Prime Minister Chandra Shumsha, which is kept at Madan Pustakaraya. In his letter, he called for Asian unity and pan-Asianism, and called Nepal the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, who spread the precious teachings of "light and moderation." Convinced that Nepal deserves the opportunity to benefit from Japan's science and technology in return, I have made several proposals for Nepal's development in areas such as education, political and financial administration, industrial development, and construction of socio-economic infrastructure. made a proposal. In this way, Pastor Kawaguchi became the first Japanese to consider the possibility of expanding Japan's cooperation in the development of Nepal. Souvenirs from Kawaguchi's trip to the Himalayas can be found at Obakuzan Manpukuji Temple in the outskirts of Kyoto, Japan.
From an early age, Kawaguchi underwent various Buddhist trainings here. Near the gate of this temple he has two tall Himalayan cicadas towering over him. It is said that the sapling of this tree was brought to Japan from Nepal and planted by Mr. Kawaguchi.

                                    As mentioned above, one of the reasons why Mr. Kawaguchi chose the Nepalese route to Tibet was the abundance of Buddhist sacred sites in Nepal. In 1896, the Ashoka Pillar was discovered in Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautam Buddha. Kawaguchi must have heard of this discovery at the time. In 1912, he made a pilgrimage to Lumbini with Professor Junjiro Takagushi. Ryudai Hasebe and others. Residents of Lumbini at that time mistaken the statue of Maya Devi, the mother of Buddha, for a Hindu deity and sacrificed animals, and at the request of Prime Minister Kawaguchi, Prime Minister Chandra Shamsha issued a decree to offer animal sacrifices. It is said. It is prohibited in Lumbini.
