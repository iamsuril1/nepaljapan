                                    In 1902, the Nepalese government decided to send eight Nepalese youths to study in Japan. To avoid inconvenience during their stay in Japan, the young people were also allowed to accompany 17 counselors. The student and his companions, who arrived in Japan on 17 June 1902, are considered the first Nepalese to land in Japan. The government of Nepal covered all travel, education and living expenses in Japan. By the way, these young people were also the first Nepali students to study abroad. Students aged 18 to 27 left Nepal with their entourage and boarded the Bombay ship "Thomas Cook" on April 29, 1902. On the way, the ship stopped at the ports of Colombo, Langor, Singapore and Hong Kong before arriving in Yokohama on 17 June.
The group stayed in Yokohama for a few days, and their accommodation was arranged by Swami Giri, a guide familiar with Tokyo. The students visited the British Legation with a letter from Prime Minister Chandra Shamsher Rana to the British Minister in Tokyo. At the request of the Prime Minister of Nepal, the Minister sent a letter to Jutaro Komura, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan on April 21, 1902, requesting permission for the youth to go on to higher education. He called the students "state students" of Nepal. The Minister of Foreign Affairs sent this letter to the Ministry of Education, and it was decided that the Nepali students would be admitted to three government institutions, the Imperial School, the Kuramae Koto Technical School, and the Nohka School in Komaba, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Education.
The students rented houses near the school in the Hongo, Asakusa, and Shibuya village districts. According to Tokyo police reports, they rented a house in Asakusa for 20 yen a month and employed five Nepali servants. Two other students rented a house in Hongo for 30 yen a month and employed 6 servants, while another two students rented a house for 30 yen a month and employed 4 servants in the same place.

                                    One student who lived in Shibuyamura rented a house for 10 Yen, and had two servants. In 1978 in Tokyo I had the opportunity to meet 86-year-old Mrs. Narita, the daughter of the landlord of Hongo. Although she was only 12 years old at that time, she remembered well the Nepali students whom she referred to as the "prince students."

Each student was placed under the supervision of a teacher at the school and in addition hired private teachers for tutoring in language, mathematics, chemistry and other related subjects. The subjects chosen by the students were:

Ammunition Technology making (Jang Narsingh Rana, Bhakta Bahadur Basnet); Mining (Bal Narsingh Raimajhi, Dev Narsingh Rana); Agriculture (Deep Narsingh Rana); Mechanical Engineering (Hem Bahadur Rajbhandari); Ceramics and Lacquer Vase (Bichar Man Singh) and Chemistry (Rudra Lal Singh). Credit should be given to the youths themselves for their efforts in overcoming the many difficulties they faced, in particular, their lack of any previous knowledge of the Japanese language. Upon their return to Nepal in 1905 all eight students found employment in their respective fields.
Among other efforts, they cast copper coins and manufactured some light ammunition. They also brought back seeds of Wisteria, Persimmon, Chestnuts, and Chrysanthemums, which were planted for the first time in Kathmandu.

Due to some odd happenings, the situation of the former students changed dramatically some years later. The Prime Minister at that time began to suspect that the youths, particularly the ammunition engineers, might have some connection with a rival Rana group. The youths were not allowed to stay together and the main suspects were sent outside the Kathmandu Valley.

It was Prime Minister Dev Shumsher Rana who planned to send Nepali youths to Japan. He learned a lot through books and people about the modernization programs of Japan since 1968, the famous Meiji Ishin, the government policy, Meiji Constitution and realized Japan was becoming a powerful nation in economy and national security. Dev Shumsher was every inch a democrat, convinced by the idea of constitutional monarchy and Parliamentary system. He saw Japan as his model. He chose an advanced Asian nation for learning probably because of some similarities between Nepal and Japan rejoining their cultural and then political situation. Unfortunately Dev Shumsher could not implement his plan during his very short period of 144 days rule. However, the next Prime Minister Chandra Shumsher Rana sent the students to Japan in April 1902.
